## HOW ARE THEY?

As the family member of an older adult living at home with the assistance of a care giver, I want to keep up to date with how they are doing, especially since I live far away from them and it"s hard to visit regularly. I want to know, did they take their medication as required? How are they feeling? When was the last time they were checked in on? This app aims to present this information in a convenient and understandable way so that if something is going wrong, I immediately know about it.

The types of events that a caregiver might log are:

- "alert qualified"
- "alert raised"
- "catheter observation"
- "check in"
- "check out"
- "concern raised"
- "fluid intake observation": includes what the fuid is and whether or not it was observed
- "food intake observation"
- "general observation"
- "incontinence pad observation"
- "medication schedule created"
- "medication schedule updated"
- "mental health observation"
- "mood observation"
- "no medication observation received"
- "physical health observation"
- "regular medication maybe taken"
- "regular medication not taken"
- "regular medication partially taken"
- "regular medication taken"
- "task completed": includes what the task is (id only)
- "task completion reverted"
- "task schedule created"
- "toilet visit recorded"
